# camera-tracking

This is an object tracking project, using a Raspberry Pi 5, a servo and a simple webcam (for now).

Its aim is to make it possible to track and follow moving objects by an autonomous drone.

It will probably be merged into the [KNR Drone team's repository](https://github.com/KNR-PW/Dron_symulacja) and integrated with ROS2
