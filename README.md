# camera-tracking

This is an object tracking project, using a Raspberry Pi 5, a servo and an RGB camera.

Its aim is to make it possible to track and follow moving objects by an autonomous drone.

The drone simulation (ROS2+Webots) part is in [KNR Drone team's repository](https://github.com/KNR-PW/Dron_symulacja). My master's thesis part is under the feature-following branch.
